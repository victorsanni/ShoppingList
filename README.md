## Learning Goal

The goal of the exercise was to learn the basic functionality of React Native and how to build an app using it. Specifically, I focused on styling, app organization, state management, and implementing key features on an app using React Native. This was my first experience with React Native, so my focus was on learning the basics and getting better with time.

## What was accomplished
At the end of the exercise, I was able to build a page for a shopping list app. I learnt how to install npm modules useful for getting more features for building apps. I learnt about the different components available in react native, specifically Stylesheet, View, Image, FlatList, Alert, etc. I also learned how to use flexboxes for styling, and how to use the Stylesheet component to create varying styles for  every container. I learned how to use functions to manage state by implementing the “add item” and “delete item” functionality. I also learned how to prompt the user with alerts. Overall, I have learned how to use React Native for basic app design.


## What was challenging
I had no previous experience with Javascript which React Native is built on, so I had to learn the syntax of the language. Installing React Native was also an issue, as the video’s instructions for installation were outdated. Also, it was difficult to import some features that were used in the video, icons for example. I kept getting an error message when trying to import icons exactly as it was done in the video, and researching online brought no solutions.
